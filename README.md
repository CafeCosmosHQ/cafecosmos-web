Cafe Cosmos Season 1 Website (Html/Blazor/Wasm)

This is the current season, html blazor wasm website.  Go to https://cafecosmoshq.github.io/cafecosmos-web/ to see it live. Source code can be found on the repository [CafeCosmosDotNet](https://github.com/CafeCosmosHQ/CafeCosmosDotNet)

This version does not automatically save and expects to have the Metamask extension, just load your private keys of the game into Metamask.

## Metamask Gas
If you are going to save any state of the game, Metamask does not calculate the gas correctly so set the gas to 0.001.
